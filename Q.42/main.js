//Q.42
// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(magicians => magicians.length);

}
function make_great(magicians) {
    for (let i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = "The Great" + " " + magicians[i];
    }
